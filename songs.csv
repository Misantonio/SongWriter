"

You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire

The earlier version finishes with the following:
Hey the sun and moon and stars are yeah..
But I won't share myself with you
You to me
",You,radiohead
"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

But how do you?
How do you?

And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

It doesn't matter anyway

Been thinking about you, your record's a hit
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're not a star
What do you care?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better

All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes and bribed the company
To come and see you, honey

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
But they don't know what I know, and why should you care
When I'm not there

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there

All the things you got, you'll never need
All the things you've got, I bled and I bleed to please you

Been thinking about you...

Destiny, destiny protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world
Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore

I never wanted anything but this
I tried hard, worked hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Everytime you're running over me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Everytime you're running out on me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

The waters break, the waters run all over me

I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray

Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

So many things that keep,  that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

And nailed into my heels

Killing what I feel

And everything I touch

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it

We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for

When they came to firebomb the house 
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no-one can touch me

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here

Chasing you home saying

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle,
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition,
Kill yourself to never ever stop

Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber bands
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing

But I can't help the feeling

Taking off and landing

I just got off the train
A frightening place
The faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?

And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads

Well sit right down my wicked son
And let me tell you a story
About the boy who fell from glory
And how he was a wicked son

This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am with my hand

He took his sister from his head
And then painted her on the sheets
And then rolled her up in grass and trees
And they kissed 'till they were dead

One night upon my motorcycle through the desert spead
And smashed my body so that all my friends thought I was dead
My sister held me close and whispered to my bleeding head
""You are the son of a mother fucker""

I shook all night and held her hand

To find out I'm Nimrod's son

Oh bury me
Far away please

In my motorcycle mirror I think about the life I've led
And how my soul's been aking all the holes where I have bled
My image spoke to me, yes to me and often said
""You are the son of incestuous union""

that he is able to keep awake for the rest of his years
he resides
on a beach
in a town

""are you looking for the mother lode?""

I think it used to sit right here
Encrusted in blue and hard and true
For now I will kiss her finger

Have you ever seen Andro Queen
Wandering all for her ruby
One day she'll come in through my window
Yes, she gave me her own true pledge

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen

Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
In a moon of milk she is scared, yes she is
Yet she shows me under her silk

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
I wave goodbye to Andro

Mi aspekti ĉe via mano al vidi la ringo
Kaj ni will promeni kune al via cambro
Nia ami will esti nova

Off to the gas and rings of Saturn
Off her head she gave me a lock, yes she did
For my neck a rusted locket

At the scene of the suicides

When is a snake a tail?

I am the silver snail

On my way back to one
On my way back to seventh son
Then I count to a million

He will awake from his dreams
Find his way in these honey beams
Find a way to the cream of creams

Silver spoons
for my silver snails
Black harpoons
for the killer whales

Saw the star carved on her chest
Goat of lust, attacking heaven
Points to the gaze of the blue eyed hexe

Shirt was opened down to her navel
Felt a burning in my solar plexus

Now Andro Queen has lost her ring
I think it used to sit right here
Encrusted in blue and hard and true
For now I will kiss her finger

Have you ever seen Andro Queen
Wandering all for her ruby
One day she'll come in through my window
Yes, she gave me her own true pledge

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen

Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
In a moon of milk she is scared, yes she is
Yet she shows me under her silk

For what's missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
I wave goodbye to Andro

Mi aspekti ĉe via mano al vidi la ringo
Kaj ni will promeni kune al via cambro

Off to the gas and rings of Saturn
Off her head she gave me a lock, yes she did
For my neck a rusted locket

My father lives in Arabia
And I live right here at my school

I took his plane to Columbia
So I could sell at my school

It's weird at my school
Weird at my school [3X]

My mother's glad that I am here
So she can visit my school

I can't believe she's so pretty
I'm a son of a bitch at my school

Weird at my school [4X]

And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor
She lives far away from the doors of my school

And often times, you know I fantasize
That I have sex with the nuns at my school

It's weird at my school

I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway

If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy
On that day

Waiting to follow 
Through the dream light of your way
Is not so easy for me now

After time has passed your way 
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now
Comeback now
Whoahohhh

Like it was going out of fashion
Dress to inflame
But douse any ideas of passion
You carry your love in a trinket
Hanging round your throat
Always inviting
Always exciting

Well I'm tired of hanging around

I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know
That it's not you

You ask me questions
That I never wanted to hear

In the footsteps of my shadow
See the lights out

In amongst the statues
Stare at nothing in

Slipping through the door
Hear my heart beats in the hallway

Drifting up the stairs

I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much, been too unkind

I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
That you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry

But wheeling suddenly around, he looked at me – I hadn't quite finished yet – and said: ""What's this? You're all crooked! What on earth are you up to?""
""Quite right. You're very observant,"" said I, my head on the seam of his trousers, which was why I couldn't look up properly.

Hello image
Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn
But you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong

You'll fall in love with somebody else

Before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets
To remember the end
And escape someday

Sunk deep in the night
I sink in the night
Standing alone underneath the sky
I feel the chill of ice
On my face

Sleep in a safe bed
Curled and protected
Protected from sight
Under a safe roof
Deep in your house
Unaware of the changes at night

I kneel and wait in silence
As one by one the people slip away
Into the night
The quiet and empty bodies
Kiss the ground before they pray
Kiss the ground
And slip away

I sit and listen dreamlessly
A promise of salvation makes me stay
Then look at your face
And feel my heart pushed in
As all around the children play
The games they tired of yesterday
They play
They play

I stand and hear my voice
Cry out
A wordless scream at ancient power
It breaks against stone
I softly leave you crying
I cannot hold what you devour

In the holy hour

The innocence of sleeping children
Dressed in white
And slowly dreaming
Stops all time
Slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never thought I'd say those words

The further we go
And older we grow
The more we know ...
The less we show ...

The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song
And quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story
And rushed to reach the end
Too soon

Oh remember
Please
Don't change

So the fall came
Thirteen years
A shiny ring
And how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

So they close together
Dressed in red and yellow
Innocent forever
Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms
Still dream

The further we go
And older we grow
The more we know ...

Whisper your name in an empty room
You brush past my skin
As soft as fur
Taking hold
I taste your scent
Distant noises
Other voices
Pounding in my broken head
Commit the sin
Commit yourself
And all the other voices said
Change your mind
You're always wrong
Always wrong

Come around at christmas
I really have to see you
Smile at me slyly
Another festive compromise
But I live with desertion
And eight million people
Distant noises
Of other voices
Pulsing in my swinging arms
Caress the sound
So many dead
And all the other voices sing
Change your mind

In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men
Begging to crush me

The textures coat my skin
In the death cell
A single note
Rings on and on and on

Two pale figures
Ache in silence
Timeless
In the quiet ground
Side by side
In age and sadness

I watched
And acted wordlessly
As piece by piece
You performed your story
Moving through an unknown past
Dancing at the funeral party

Memories of childrens dreams
Lie lifeless
Fading
Lifeless
Hand in hand with fear and shadows
Crying at the funeral party

I heard a song 
And turned away
As piece by piece
You performed your story
Noiselessly across the floor
Dancing at the funeral party
",The Funeral Party,cure
"
Stop my flight to fight
And die
And take a stand to change my life
So savage with red desperation
I clench my hands
You draw your claws
A hidden rage consumes my heart
Fuelled by years of wasted time
I close my eyes
And tense myself
And screaming
Throw myself in fury over the edge
And into your blood

Tear at flesh
And rip at skin
And smash at doubt
I have to break you
Fury drives my vicious blows
I see you fall but still I strike you
Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Drained of everything but pain

Screaming throw myself in fury
Over the edge and into your blood

Kiss you once and see you writhe
Hold you close and hear you cry
Kiss your eyes and finish your life
Kiss your eyes
Finish your life

Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Knowing I'll murder you again tonight

Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again
Knowing I'll murder you again

She stands twelve feet above the flood
She stares
Alone
Across the water

The loneliness grows and slowly
Fills her frozen body
Sliding downwards

One by one her senses die
The memories fade
And leave her eyes
Still seeing worlds that never were
And one by one the bright birds leave her ...

Starting at the violent sound
She tries to turn
But final
Noiseless
Slips and strikes her soft dark head
The water bows
Receives her
And drowns her at its ease
Drowns her at its ease

I would have left the world all bleeding
Could I only help you love
The fleeting shapes
So many years ago
So young and beautiful and brave

Everything was true
It couldn't be a story

I wish it was all true
I wish it couldn't be a story
The words all left me
Lifeless
Hoping
Breathing like the drowning man

Oh Fushia
You leave me
Breathing like the drowning man
Breathing like the drowning man

Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time
I turn away
Lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly I see you change
Everything at once
The same
But the mountain never moves

Rape me like a child
Christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead
And old
And always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please
Say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand forever
Lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

I went away alone
With nothing left
But faith
",Faith,cure
"
It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time
A story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth
And we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer
For something better

Please love me
Meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?
She struggles to get away . . .

The pain
And the creeping feeling
A little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday
The death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me
And turn me round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man
And painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance
Under a black flag
A hundred years of blood
Crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth
And my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over
We die one after the other
Over and over
We die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other

It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years

One hundred years

Movement
No movement
Just a falling bird
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground
He lived and died
Catch sight
Cover me with earth
Draped in black
Static
White sound

A day without substance
A change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colours that flicker in water
A short term effect

Scream
As she tries to push him over
Helpless and sick
With teeth of madness
Jump jump dance and sing
Sideways across the desert
A charcoal face
Bites my hand
Time is sweet
Derange and disengage everything

A day without substance
A change of thought
The atmosphere rots with time
Colours that flicker in water
A short term effect

A short term effect
A short term effect
An echo
And a stranger's hand
A short term effect
An echo

Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In the hanging garden
Please don't speak
In the hanging garden
No one sleeps
In the hanging garden
In the hanging garden

Catching haloes on the moon
Gives my hands the shapes of angels
In the heat of the night

In the heat of the night
Walking into a dream . . .

I chose an eternity of this
Like falling angels
The world disappeared
Laughing into the fire
Is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours
The first kiss

We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile
Siamese twins
A girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me
It falls apart

The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands
Slowly up the stairs
And into the room
Is it always like this?

Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows
With arms outstretched
Her legs around me

In the morning I cried

Leave me to die
You won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk
We never smile
I scream
You're nothing
I don't need you any more
You're nothing

It fades and spins
Fades and spins

Sing out loud
We all die
Laughing into the fire

Is it always like this?
Is it always like this?
Is it always like this?

Sharp and open
Leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting
In the cold light
A noise
A scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow
Please let me sleep
As I slip down the window
Freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing
You mean nothing

I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time
Lose me in the dark
Please do it right
Run into the night
I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain
My heart explodes
My memory in a fire
And someone will listen
At least for a short while

I can never say no to anyone but you

Too many secrets
Too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets
Please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me
In sequence
In despair of time

I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes
Pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again

Touch her eyes
Press my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again

Give me your eyes
That I might see the blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming
My head turns to dust as he plays on his knees
As he plays on his knees

And the sand
And the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind
Dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
Sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

And the sand
And the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away
On a strange day

My head falls backs
And the walls crash down
And the sky
And the impossible
Explode
Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone
Forever

A strange day

Scarred
Your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be kissed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait
Await the next breath
Your name
Like ice into my heart

A shallow grave
A monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon
Another past time
Your name
Like ice into my heart

Everything as cold as life
Can no one save you?
Everything
As cold as silence
And you never say a word

Your name
Like ice into my heart

Like ice into my heart

A hand in my mouth
A life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect
As we all fall down
In an electric glare
The old man cracks with age
She found his last picture
In the ashes of the fire
An image of the queen
Echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books
And films
And in life
And in heaven
The sound of slaughter
As your body turns

But it's too late
But it's too late

One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh
And real blood
I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes

I must fight this sickness
Find a cure
I must fight this sickness

Doo doo doo doo

Let me take your hand
I'm shaking like milk
Turning
Turning blue
All over the windows and the floors
Fires outside in the sky
Look as perfect as cats
The two of us
Together again
But it's just the same
A stupid game

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first

You think you're tired now
But wait until three
Laughing at the Christmas lights
You remember from December
All of this then back again
Another girl
Another name
Stay alive but stay the same
It's just the same
A stupid game

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first

You can't even see now
So you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real
Because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway
And into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here
When I came here alone

You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much
Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing
Dancing in our hands
Dancing
Dancing

Dizzy dizzy dizzy
As I speak
Like a tumbling cat
I watch in fascination
Like a vampire bat
Don't do it don't do it
Don't do it don't do it
Don't give it away
We'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today

Rest your head
Oh just put it outside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night
The dream
The time love died

We pushed it in our mouths
Pushed it deep inside
All wrapped up in ribbons

The time

I remember the time that you rained all night
The queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank
But nobody opened their eyes

Remember that time that the trees fell down
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead
But nobody woke up at all

Somebody died for this
Somebody died for just one kiss

Remember the time that the sky went black
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea
But nobody held out their hands

Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss

Just one kiss

I love it all
These games we play
I close my eyes
You run away
I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
And so I feel the grey
Pulse in my head
I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine
But my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you dear
That's for sure

When it gets to four
It's my turn to go
Oh the kiss
So alcoholic and slow
Arranging me for Saturday
I thought you would know
That I always sleep
Alone

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you
Dear
That's for sure

The upstairs room is cool and bright
We can go up there in summer
And dance all night

Your sister started talking at a minute after ten
So everyone jumped up
And then fell over again
In April you can join them
And stare at me

I called you after midnight
Then ran until my heart burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look
Like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile

Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh the smell as candles die

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge

We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss

We slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night

Let's go
And throw
All the songs we know

Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile

The after-taste of anger in the back of my mouth
Spit it on the wall
And cough some more
And scrape my skin with razor blades

And make up in the new blood
And try to look so good
Follow me

And follow me to where the real fun is

Spurning sex like an animal of god

And hold you blazing
Hold you cherished in the dead electric light

As if I knew you'd disappear away

This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning burning deep outside

Night time night time
Sets my house on fire

I'll lose my life

And never turn away
Sends me all her love

Like a dying man
It moved with hopeful tears
With the tears of the blind

And on and on as the night drew in
Through broken streets
That sucked me in

With walking to the promised land

I pushed through crowds
Through seas of prayer
Through twisting hands and choking air

Get your fingers out of my face

Gasping for air
I'm gasping for air
I'm gasping for love

Then eat the sweet sticky things
Suck harder suck harder
Suck your insides insides out

Blood thick swimming round your feet
As you're choking
Choking
Choking on the fleshy words

Deaden my glassy mind
Give me it give me it give me it

One step back and one step down
And slip the needles in my side

Cracks in the pale blue wall

Always away

Of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you
Of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream

Hold my mouth
To hold in a scream

Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears

I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought that this day would end
I never thought that tonight could ever be
This close to me

Just try to see in the dark
Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out
Hold my breath
And wait until I shake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can't stand here like this anymore

Yes I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yes I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow

You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name

And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember
Even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sort of far away

In a bed made of flowers
If only tonight we could fall

You want to know why I hate you?
Well I'll try and explain...
You remember that day in Paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light...

And in the road before us
Stood a weary greyish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than the air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

The father's eyes said ""Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful!
She shimmers like a star!""
The childs eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are

I turned to look at you
To read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
""I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!""

The fathers eyes said ""Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!""
The boys eyes said
""How beautiful! She glitters like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered joy
And stilled my heart with sadness
For the way we are

And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no-one ever knows or loves another

Or loves another

Well we're a mile under the ground
And I'm thinking that it's Christmas
And I'm kissing you hard
Like I've got very important business
And no-one knows
And no-one sees us
Because they're drinking themselves senseless
And I'm writhing
And I'm writhing
And I'm writhing in the snakepit

Well I'm out in a car
And it's just full of stupid girls
And I've forgotten how to speak

And threw her arms around my neck
""Show me how you do it,

I kissed her face and kissed her head

Alone above a raging sea

And drowned her deep inside of me

And looked around
At all the gardens that looked
Back at her house
(Like all the faces
That quiz when you smile...)

And he was standing
At the corner
Where the road turned dark
A part of shiny wet
Like blood the rain fell
Black down on the street

And kissed his feet she fell
Her head an inch away from heaven
And her face pressed tight
And all around the night sang out
Like cockatoos

""There are a thousand things"" he said
""I'll never say those things to you again""
And turning on his heel
He left a trace of bubbles
Bleeding in his stead

And in her head
A picture of a boy who left her

That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are

Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in

How I always held close in your fear

Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky

I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Expectant, too punctual
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever

But older than me now
More constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment
That hangs in abasement

Where once there was only a girl

I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered

In the heart of December
The blindness of happiness
Of falling down laughing
And I really believed that this time was forever

But Christmas falls late now

On candy stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and suddenly!
A movement in the corner of the room!
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!

Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow
And quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
""Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light

And the spiderman is always hungry...

Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
The shallow drowned, lose less than we
You breathe the strangest twist upon your lips

Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

I really don't know what I'm doing here
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight but...
Just one drink
And there're some people to meet you
I think that you'll like them
I have to say we do
And I promise in less than an hour we will honestly go
Now why don't I just get you another
While you just say hello...

Yeah just say hello...

So I'm clutching it tight
Another glass in my hand
And my mouth and the smiles
Moving up as I stand up
Too close and too wide
And the smiles are too bright
And I breathe in too deep
And my head's getting light
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer
And I'm starting to sway
And the hands on all my shoulders don't have names
And they won't go away
So here I go
Here I go again...

Falling into strangers
And it's only just eleven
Ans I'm staring like a child
Until someone slips me heaven
And I take it on my knees
Just like a thousand times before
And I get transfixed
That fixed
And I'm just looking at the floor
Just looking at the floor
Yeah I look at the floor

And I'm starting to laugh
Like an animal in pain
And I've got blood on my hands
And I've got hands in my brain
And the first short retch
Leaves me gasping for more
And I stagger over screaming
On my way to the floor
And I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the colour and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size
So here I go
Here I go again...

Yeah I laugh and I jump
And I sing and I laugh
And I dance and I laugh
And I laugh and I laugh
And I can't seem to think
Where this is
Who I am
Why I'm keeping this going
Keep pouring it out
Keep pouring it down
And the way the rain comes down hard
That's the way I feel inside...

I can't take it anymore
This it I've become
This is it like I get
When my life's going numb
I just keep moving my mouth
I just keep moving my feet
I say I'm loving you to death
Like I'm losing my breath
And all the smiles that I wear
And all the games that I play
And all the drinks that I mix
And I drink until I'm sick
And all the faces that I make
And all the shapes that I throw
And all the people I meet
And all the words that I know
Makes me sick to the heart
Oh I feel so tired...

And the way the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside...
",Open,cure

When I see you sky as a kite
As high as I might
I can't get that high
The how you move
The way you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try

When I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips
I can't lick that far
But when you pout
The way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

And when I see you
Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say I'll keep on holding you in
My arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah as smitten as that
I can't get that small
The way you fur
The how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make-believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave

And when I see you
Take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I know I'll keep on holding you
In arms so tight
They'll never let you go

He waits for her to understand
But she won't understand at all
She waits all night for him to call
But he won't call anymore
He waits to hear her say
Forgive
But she just drops her pearl-black eyes
And prays to hear him say
I love you
But he tells no more lies

He waits for her to sympathize
But she won't sympathize at all
She waits all night to feel his kiss
But always wakes alone
He waits to hear her say
Forget
But she just hangs her head in pain
And prays to hear him say
No more
I'll never leave again

How did we get this far apart?
We used to be so close together
How did we get this far apart?
I thought this love would last forever

He waits for her to understand
But she won't understand at all
She waits all night for him to call

Every time we do this
I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave
It's all for her
I know this can't be wrong I say
(And I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong
Right here with you
Right here with you...

And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try
Put your hands in the sky
Surrender
Remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye...

I've never been so
Colourfully-see-through-head before
I've never been so
Wonderfully-me-you-want-some-more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone
A secret kiss
And don't go home
Don't go away
Don't let this end
Please stay
Not just for today

Never never never never never let me go she says
Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days
But suddenly she slows
And looks down at my breaking face
Why do you cry? what did I say?
But it's just rain I smile
Brushing my tears away...

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry?
Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something
We will always want?

Why why why are you letting me go? she says
I feel you pulling back
I feel you changing shape...
And just as I'm breaking free
She hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky
Surrenders it all...

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried for you
It's always the same
Wake up in the rain
Head in pain
Hung in shame
A different name
Same old game
Love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again...

You look like you could do with a friend she said
You look like you could use a hand
Someone to make you smile she said
Someone who can understand
Share your trouble
Comfort you
Hold you close
And I can do all of these
I think you need me here with you

You look like you do with a sister she said
You look like you need a girl to call your own...
Like fabulous! fabulous!
Call me fabulous!
And rubbing her hands so slow
You stare at me all strange she said
Are you hungry for more?
I've had enough I said
Please leave me alone
Please go

It doesn't touch me at all
It doesn't touch me at all

You know that you could do with a friend she said
You know that you could use a word
Like feel or follow or fuck she said
And laughing away as she turned
You've everything but no-one
Like the last man on earth
And when I die I said
I'll leave you it all
Door closes
Leaves me cold

It doesn't touch me at all
It doesn't touch me at all

You really do need a sister she said
You really do need a girl to call your own...
Like wonderful! wonderful!

And running her hands so slow
You stare at me all strange she said

It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges
Boats
And other dreary worlds you know
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile without a doubt
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump and sing and shout
Let's get happy!

But it's much to late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
For rip-zipping button-popping kiss and well...
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
And you don't give a further thought
To things like feet
Let's get happy!

But it's much too late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never to late
To get up and go

Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house!
Burn down the street!
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye

It's a perfect day for getting wild
Forgetting all your worries
Life
And everything that makes you cry
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
For thinking big
And doing anything you want to do
Let's get happy!

But it's much to late you say
For doing this now
We should have done it then
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house!
Burn down the street!
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...

It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday

There's no-one left in the world

Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would
If they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else
That hides away
From me and you
There're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round
Yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back
The way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away
The way you do

Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke
And the make-believe ran out...

Oh Elise
It doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else
I can really do
At all...

If only you'd never speak to me
The way that you do
If only you'd never speak like that
It's like listening to
A breaking heart
A falling sky
Fire go out and friendship die
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do

If only you'd never look at me
The way that you do
If only you'd never look like that
When I look at you
I see face like stone
Eyes of ice
Mouth so sweetly telling lies
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do
But you don't
You don't feel anymore

Pulling you back close to me

Remember how it used to be
When the sun would fill the sky
Remember how we used to feel
Those days would never end

Remember how it used to be
When the stars would fill the sky
Remember how we used to dream
Those nights would never end

It was the hope of all we might have been
That filled me with the hope to wish
Impossible things
To wish impossible things

And all the sky is grey
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
And all I wish is gone away

Where giving up and going on

And hopes for something more from me

Of every blood dark sea
And every soul black night

Anything I haven't got
Everything

I just can't stop
Planning all my days away
But never finding ways to stay
Or ever feel enough today

More lust more lies more head more love
More fear more fun more pain more flesh
More stars more smiles more fame more sex
But however hard I want
I know deep down inside
I'll never really get more hope
Or any more time
Any more time

I want lightning and thunder
I want blood instead of rain

I want to walk on water

I ride into your town on a big black trojan horse
I'm looking to have some fun

I couldn't help but notice your icy blue eyes
They've been burning two holes in the sides of my head
Since the second I arrived

And it's not too hard to guess from your stick-on stars
And your canary feather dress

And you don't really care what I call you at all
When I can't quite remember your name

And it's not too hard to guess from your stick-on stars
And your canary feather dress

And I have to turn away to keep from bursting

It started with a dedication
""lost in admiration - happy birthday - I'm forever yours - blossom""
Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies
I smiled surprised at how when flickered through
The wings flew by spelled out my name...

Six months went by the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft blood smooth flowing hand
""please try to understand - I have to see you - have to feel you -

The year grew old incessantly she wrote to me
She'd started smoking poetry!
I laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase
She'd pulled me in...
I answered her
A christmas card in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet...

Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
""can I use some of your lipstick?""
It was perfect so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms...

I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same...

""I'm sorry - blame infatuation - blame imagination -
I was sure you'd be the one but I was wrong -
It seems reality destroys our dreams - I won't forget you - blossom""

And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you

Round and round and round and round and round we go
Trying so hard to get a hold of everyone here

We squeak with idiot fake surprise
Flap our hands and flutter our eyes
And lap up all their stupid lies
We've got to love them all

Imitation smiles and how ""it's wonderful to be here!""

So round and round and round and round and round we go
Hanging on every shape they throw
It's strange the way we can't say no

And smoke and choke and point and poke
And gag on countless lines...

A year ago today we stood
Above this same awakening world
I held you...
You never wanted me to know
Another year ago today
Before this same awakening world
I held you...
I never meant to let you go
There was a moment
There always is
When time stood still
And always was this...
One endless moment
You turn in pain
And I always let you go
Over and over again...
A year ago tonight we lay
Below this same remembering sky
I kissed you
You never wanted me to know...
Another year ago tonight

Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to give
Nothing more in you
Nothing else to have or hold
Nothing left but time to go

Years go by
We didn't really say that much at all
And months just fly
We didn't ever really touch at all
Weeks always run down
We didn't really get that close at all
And days fall out
We didn't ever really know at all

And then we're here in a room
Too clean and too bright
She stares at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room
So mean and so white
I stare at her in this room
As she stares into the night

Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to ask
Nothing more of you
Nothing else to share or show
Nothing left but time to go

No eternity of life
In his eyes as we turned
No infinity of why
In his eyes as we turned
No beautiful goodbye
In his eyes as we turned
Nothing but tears

In his eyes as we turned
Nothing but tears

The dawn call was broken, short, disconnected, far away
I couldn't understand too much of what was being said
A matter of minutes, peacefully, so sorry
I had to think to breathe, my heart bursting in my head
We moved in silence through a slowly waking world of pale grey rain
And as we drove, a strange sun split the sky
In that moment I knew nothing would ever be the same again
I knew nothing would ever be the same again
Nothing would ever be the same again

The days fall out
The weeks always run down
The months just fly
The years go by

And then we're here in a room
Too clean and too bright
I stare at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room
So mean and so white
You stare at me in this room
As I stare into the night

Nothing more to do
Nothing left to take
Nothing more from you
Nothing else to need or know

And I feel so scared
That you're going away
And I feel so scared

All I want is summer
Stories from before
It's like the day you tired to hide 
Behind the churchyard wall
And feel asleep before I came
I found you in a chain of flowers

Sleeping like a marble girl
Sleeping in another world

I will never tell you
All the different ways
All the different ways 
You make me so afraid

Waiting for the world to end

Slipping me away from you

All the voices blur
Change to one face
Change to one voice

Prepare yourself for bed
The light seems bright
And glares on white walls
All the sounds of Charlotte sometimes

Into the night with Charlotte sometimes

Night after night she lay alone in bed
Her eyes so open to the dark
The streets all looked so strange
They seemed so far away but Charlotte did not cry

The people seemed so close
Some playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close
So many other names

Sometimes I'm dreaming
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Charlotte sometimes

Sometimes I'm dreaming
Expressionless the trance
Sometimes I'm dreaming
So many different names

Sometimes I'm dreaming
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world

Come to me scared princess, Charlotte sometimes

On that bleak track see the sun is gone again
The tears were pouring down her face
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before

Sometimes I dream
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte sometimes

Sometimes I dream
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
So many different names

Sometimes I dream, sometimes I dream

Crying for herself

Dreams a wall around herself

But it's always with love
With so much love
It looks like everything else

""So we meet again!"" and I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand
Yeah it's a look I used to know
""Three long years and your favorite man
Is that any way to say hello?""
And you hold me like you'll never let me go

""Oh c'mon and and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while...""
""Oh I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time""
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eye

So dizzy Mr Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come

It's so hard to think ""It ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance""
Because it's hard to think
""I'll never get another chance
To hold you to hold you""

But chilly Mr Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over, over
And you're gone

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much

But how how many times can I walk away and wish ""If only""
But how many times can I talk this way and wish ""If only""
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish ""If only""

But ""If only""

I heard you feel down
Well that's too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's
Gone out of your life.
Well that's just too bad

Tell me how high Do you think you'll go

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW ?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall

She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train

What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?

Or have I finally found something worth living for?

Sing a sad song
In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found this place
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel 

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day

Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If your honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song

Need a shoulder? well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back 

You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me 

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now! 

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain

The first thing I saw
As I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
That I want you to know
What is written inside of your head 

And time as it stands
Won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?

Around this town you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's gonna take the blame for ... 

My big mouth, my big name
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?
Into my big mouth you could fly a plane
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?

I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assasin
Only then you'll realize
With who's life you have been messin'

An extraordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day,
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
But he is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind 

They are sleeping while they dream
And then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword.
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
But they are like a child with nothing to lose
In their minds, their minds. 

But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine 

Cos you see me I got my Magic Pie
Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone.

Many minds to educate and people who have disappeared

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn.

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new.
Don't you know

They're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I've gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's no disgrace
Cos in the end the past means nothing 

You tell me I'm free then you tie me down
And from my chains I think it's a pity
What did it cost you to wear my crown
You dont like me why don't you admit it 

D'you feel a little down today?
Bet you ain't got much to say?
But your gonna miss me when I'm not there

Wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touchdown bass living on the run
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging 

Wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capital city in the sun 

Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born
Sing a song for me one from 'Let It Be'

Say Something shout it from the roof tops off your head
Make it sort of mean something make me understand or I'll forget
The people here on life's beaches they wish upon the waves that hide the sand
Let them know that life teaches you to build a castle in the hand 

Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone
So bring it on home and it wont be long

Hey! What was that you said to me?
Just say the word and I'd be free?
And where the stars are shining bright

We'll amuse ourselves

Chewin' on a bone
A thousand million
Miles from home
When Something hit me
Somewhere right between the eyes 

Sleepin' on a plane
You know you can't complain
You took your last chance
Once again

Hardly even knew your name

Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life

Won't ever make you cry

Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothing to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came

The answers just the same

Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside 

Thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
I feel love 

I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breath 

Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love

Little James, we're all the same
They always seem to look to us
But we weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us 

You live for your toys, even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plastercine
Or even tried a trampoline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us 

I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
'Cos it won't be long before everyone is gone

What tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains?
Sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night
I think he don't got a name but I can't be certain
And in me he starts to confide 

That my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And if you hear me tap on your window
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way 

My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer
My eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
And if there's a god would he give another chancer
An hour to sing for his soul 

Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

You know that feeling you get
You feel you're older than time
You ain't exactly sure
If you've been away a while 

Do you keep the receipts
For the friends that you buy
And ain't it bittersweet
You were only just getting by 

But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong? 

And until you've repaid
The dreams you bought for your lies
You'll be cast away
Alone under the stormy skies 

But I hope you know

And I hope you know that it's touch and go

Here's another sunday morning call
Yer hear yer head-a-banging on the door
Slip your shoes on and then out you crawl
Into a day that couldn't give you more
But what for?

Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
He thought he was king creole
Until he found out, until he found out 

He sits upon a throne
He lives a sleazy lie

Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose

Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Fading like the stars we wish to be

You know I didn't mean what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed
And it just don't matter now

'Cause little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we give to you

You know I didn't mean what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed
And it just don't matter now

'Cause little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life

I'm all over my heart's desire,
I feel cold but I'm back in the fire,
Out of control but I'm tied up tight,
Come in, come out tonight.

I'm comin' up in the early morning,
I feel love in the shock of the lightning,
I fall into the blinding light,
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight.

Love is a time machine,
Up on the silver screen,
It's all in my mind,
Love is a litany,
A magical mystery,
And all in good time, and all in good time,
And all in good time.

I got my feet on the street but I can't stop flyin',
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm tryin',
I'm out of control but I'm tied up tight,
Come in, come out tonight.

There's a hole in the ground into which I'm fallin',
So God speaks to the sound of the poundin',
I'm all into the blinding light,
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight..

Love is a time machine,
Up on the silver screen,
It's all in my mind,
Love is a litany,

And all in good time, and all in good time,

Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on keepin' on

Out to sea
Is the only place I honestly
Can get myself some piece of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly

Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
Because If I am to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

The summer sun, that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known

A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all

We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known

Catch the wheel that breaks a butterfly
Cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called Him up in and out of nowhere
I said if You won't save me, please don't waste my time

Just had to take it on the chin

Last night these two bouncers and one of em's alright
The other one's the scary
And his way or no way, totalitarian

He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he don't want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay

And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?

He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think he wants it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

And, that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to what you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

""Shall I keep rolling?""

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up

And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way

Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!

But you're feeling the same 
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

Lady, where has your love gone?

It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun

Or throwing her to the sharks

But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't she murmurs things to confirm
That the tragedy is true
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Really love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, ""It's the red wine this time,"" but that is no excuse

Old yellow bricks,
Love's a risk,
Quite the little Escapologist
Looked so miffed,
When you wished,
For a thousand places better than this,

You are the fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she deemed dull,
Lead to nights reading beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you don't know what you're running from,
You can't kid us,
And you couldn't trick anyone,
Houdini, love you don't know what you're running away from,

Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up,
Blinded by nostalgia?
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasn't all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from,

She said, ""I want to sleep in a city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia.""
I know I said, ""Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"" but

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

He’s certainly come into his own,
There’s one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it’s boring to him
It’s a war you can’t win and the first and the last are two things you’ll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldn’t the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she’s going
But don’t know where she’s been
And as opposed to the ‘other thing’
He’ll worry about it when it’s trouble he’s in

Outside the café by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick'n'mix

Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your pasttimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I loved that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past times consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called ""Crying Lightning""
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well told gripe

But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here

To be attempted on a Wednesday night
It's better than to get a reputation
As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture

The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along

Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant, was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat

And even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

And threw caution to the colourful

Until the bumps woke me up in your grip

And then swept me back down to your palms

Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir

My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true

Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you, with you

And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And you're splashing in my eyelids

I thought I saw you in The Battleship but it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast when I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook, huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look and kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close and she held me very tightly until I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt and kept my short cuts to myself

I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak and she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

Black as a beacon
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was

If you were heat-seeking
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
That knows

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs

Meant she never had to strain her back

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island,
Time-traveling diamond
Cutter shaped heartaches
Come to find you
Four in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say
Is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days
Great escape
Lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine? Mine?)

And the thrill of the chase
Moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say
""You got me, baby. Are you mine?""

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone

The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby, I feel like I've been here before

Will you pour me one for the road?

Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind

It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips 'round the Mexican Coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like...

So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
Just to get the ball to roll

There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same

'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving

Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply,
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?

You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough-drop-coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phone book I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets

Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape

They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Soundtracked by a chorus of ""You don't know what you're doing""

I want an interesting synonym to describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold

Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway and his sons
Because it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just trying to orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone because you have the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once

Well I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Was gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all

Well I'm looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You probably didn't give me the eye but I'm sure you did

Well I went outside
Couldn't say I tried
And I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet

But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well I dashed around tried to find you

What a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide

When you left the house this evening, 
You said you'd be back in a little while 
Well I've been waiting for such a long time, 
And this wait is driving me wild... 

And while I wait I think about you, 
Do you need me when I'm not there? 
Are you planning to be without me? 
Do you have a new attract?

Both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I'll go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone

It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw, it's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tear you out the day after a triumph is as hollow
As the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'Bye'

And you would queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl bluff
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let them join the club

He knows how to put a cork in the fuss
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try

In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

And the furniture
Start to seem important

And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc

Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers

You've never met before,
But still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll,
She's definitely one of those,
But you'll go wherever she goes,

And when my body and my mind,
Both start talking at the exact same time,
Trying to think of ways to make her mine,
Bit difficult to find.

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give it to me.

She said...

""Oh, well I know this will sound cold,
But I really have to go,
Oh, it's not that I'm not free,
There's nowhere I need to be,
It's just your love's not what I need,
So don't give it to me.""

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give to me.

She said ""Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck? ""
No point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck.

It's more a hunger than a thirst,
You'll break it out the second time,
Before you know about the first,
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch,
But you'll let her do your worst.

And it's not hard to tell,
It's obvious the other angels faces fell,
When she told them that she had to go,
Trade her wings and overcoat for something colourful.

It's not what I need,
No, your love's not what I need,
So don't give to me.

You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And all the curtain leads to fever

We watched the womanizer cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Convey excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merry men
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

And the tumble splits the fray
Revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

The days drag their heels
When you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brats

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowels hide and wait to rot away
The identities of the willing

Rocketing shutter doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

And try to avoid the top

And the bows on the shoes you kicked off

A bare arithmetic 
Look for the boy who was hanging his head low 
More trophies and ideas 
To follow their pretend

With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face 
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles

And skipped against the rode 
Did start not to find the dark lead and catch that man i hope 
Devices man are closed

And with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face 
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles,

Failed to blunt or hinder, a slow collapse

We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends,
Caused enticement ? in the air,
I mean day 'n' night,
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight,
Smoking, drinking, joyriding,
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding,
Reckless gangsters ? no direction,
No sign of correction,
But then i switched it off,
Changed my ways,
What the hell!
Like oh my days ,
But like my naughty friends,
They're not phased,
Can't believe that this music pays,
See no reason why we can't do,
All the things we've always done,
Still in my heart I know thats just what,
But its hard to fight the temptation son.

Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
and violently you swung, through unfamiliar tounge
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At some mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet it surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with a mind on clever lines
Why not the rounder's pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
(To give me the invite don't worry it's alright)

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me

Up from the pastures of boredom
out from the sea of discontent
they come in packs like hungry hounds
Up seekers of the dark enchantment.

They haunt the boulevards and bars
they pray to wishing wells and stars
they ride the hurricane of hope
not looking back but on they go
toward the distance and deceiving
and all the while they keep believing
they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when they pair off two by two
they feel they are the chosen few
and though their beds are made of straw
they feel like velvet in the night
and so the night is never ending
its made of distance and pretending
coz they're special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love goes away
and when love goes...
goodbye...
catches in their throats like cotton
rises in their hearts like rain
the good times suddenly are all forgotten
the hunt begins again.

They search the subways and the streets
their faces tired, like their feet
their bodies aching to be warm
and so they hide behind the moon
their loneliness inside them growing
but they take comfort in just knowing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers

And when love comes again
and when love comes
hello...
rises from their throats like singing
catches in their hearts like wind
the good things
strangers in their arms are bringing
makes life all right again.

They turn their faces to the light
no longer hiding in the night
so unashamed and unafraid
that they can face each others faults
and though the waltz will have its ending
there is no harm in just pretending
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

The smiles as she walked in the room have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune to what they did before
Her head's red raw and the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And no would be...

Oh, it's uncertain whether the curtain has shut for good
She says ""See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me-""
Well I interrupted, received the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

Would it be outrageous to say we're either shouting or we're shagging, docked in tempestuous bays?
At least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me like Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me we can't go back to the chest touching on the back

The mixture between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

And does it get on your nerves,
Make you slightly perturbed,
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with yer,
seem awful empty without her.

Down no telephone line,

And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into my airspace

But I always had the time for the medicine

And it probably matters
It probably matters
I didn't have the grace or the brains
And it probably mattered
It probably mattered
I was pawning my days away

By the seaside then
On the beach with my friends
Wanna see you dive in
Beyond the reef it's thriving
On the beach we're rising
Wanna see you dive in

I need answers
In the end we'll meet again

By the seaside then

How many hours I gave for this
How many hours of pain and bliss

It probably matters

Slow day and I go straight for your heart
You say, ""Alright, big deal, so what?""
My kind of heroes are weak
Restless, alone, on the street
No shame, it's a real drain on your heart
I know how you feel

""Release me now"", she said
We're always neverending
It's just a process that took your faith
All at once
We had time enough to reach inside
And nobody changed
And no reply
We're falling down
All at once

Lately, I'm always awake
Shit, I got no friends
To meet today
Go swing your heels from the dark
Your ghost in your wheels
No shame, it's a real drain on your heart
You say, ""Alright, big deal, so what?""

""Release me now"", she said
We're always neverending
It's just the prospects that took your blanks
All at once
We're having time enough to reach inside
And nobody changed
And no reply
We're breaking down
All at once
All at once

We felt it time enough
To reach inside
And nobody wins
So dignified could throw us down
All at once
Answer, answer, answer
All at once
Answer, answer, answer

I'd like to tour the 80's
But I got sideswiped and came right to '78
My life is pro creation
Well if the mood's right, there's some hype, some currency
So, deep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing
Well I like, my life is pro creation
So I make time to rewind those memories and play

'Cause you and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You're on

You get high like you chase the natives
And you tried then to show them your come-and-see face
I like this elevation
The mood's right, the dim light, we can see them
Deep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing
Well I like, I like to change the station
'Cause these thoughts are those thoughts that cover me in grey

You and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You're always shattered

Lately something has come over all of me
My welts all undressed, no longer seem to weep
That no longer meets their needs
I like the stage so please
Holla at The Weeknd for me

You and me, you and me make a fine mess
'Cause you and me make a fine mess
You're always shattered

Why don't you see it?
Why don't you feel me?
I won't be keeped
You are misteaching me

Cave on, stay showed, ah

I got you seeking my company
I have to build through those eyes
To see that world complete
That world comes to me

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how it works

I saw you speaking, I don't believed
You're not of speaking
I have to lead you to change
This change I can lead, honey

You got your secrets
Your sacred team
I'm not betraying your eyes to leave that come me
With no complications

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how to getting comfort
I can show you how this works
I can show you how to getting comfort

It's a little tossing world
Positioned in time
And smiling, put that's all behind
It's my world, it's peaceful
It's very kind
Inside this, I leave your eyes
Talk to me

Now that I'm knowing you
I can show you what is what
Now that I'm knowing you
I can show you how to getting comfort
Stopped, letting go
I can show you how it works

I can show you what is what
I can show you how you're upgrading
Now that I know you
I can show you how it works
